This project was developed as part of an academic project focusing on building a complete data analytics pipeline. The objective was to design a data warehouse, write complex SQL queries to extract actionable insights, and present findings for decision-making. The project reflects my skills in data management, SQL, and structured data analysis.

Project Overview:

- Data Warehouse: Designed and created a data warehouse from transactional data spanning 11 tables, focusing on aggregating insights from at least 6 tables to track meaningful business metrics.
  
- SQL Queries: Developed 8 advanced SQL queries to answer critical business questions, including complex operations such as joins, subqueries, and aggregation functions. The queries are designed to uncover valuable trends and provide actionable insights for an organization.
  
- Insights and Reporting: The findings from these queries were analyzed and documented, providing recommendations on how these insights could guide strategic business decisions.
