My project involved creating a comprehensive data warehouse and utilizing it for insightful analysis and visualizations.

Design and Creation of a Data Warehouse: I designed a data warehouse, integrating data from multiple sources. This involved selecting relevant fields, aggregating data, and ensuring the warehouse includes data from at least six tables with appropriate aggregate statistics.

SQL Queries for Data Analysis: The project required crafting eight SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the data warehouse. These queries ranged from simple data retrieval to more complex ones involving joins, groupings, and aggregate functions. Each query was aimed at providing actionable insights for business decisions.
